# Learning To Make Better Portfolios

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I'm using a [tutorial created by Lama Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WwtzsSHdpI).

## What I'm Looking to Learn

Cleaner and more advanced CSS (in this case Sass) as well as animations and functionality without relying on other CSS frameworks.
